This is a little game I've been working on, and I decided I would give people the opportunity to play it as I work on it.
It does require a password in order to unzip.

Alpha 1.0.0 has very little functionality, so don't expect to be intertained by it for very long. Also Little Knight is a working title.

There is currently no exit button, so you have two choices, you can press alt+tab, or you could use ctrl+alt+del.

Also if you like to give money to people, you can help me buy some gas for my car here [![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/X8X7OHOQ0).
