### The game
This is a little game I've been working on, and I decided I would give people the opportunity to play it as I work on it. As of now it's going to be an atmospheric action survival, puzzle horror game.

### Notes and updates
v1.0.14-alpha is the newest release which has added 3d trees.

If you're on the main page, all you have to do to download is scroll up until you see on the right side, a button called releases.
Tap on it and then find the version you want to use, tap on that and then scroll down to the 7z and zip files and tap one of them to start the download.

A menu with an exit button was added to v1.0.13-alpha and higher, but if you happen to use an older version you have two choices, you can press alt+tab, or you could use ctrl+alt+del.

### Help me develop the game
I will most likely not be accepting help, especially so early in development. If I was to accept help, it would have to be from someone I already know.
With that said, if I was to need help on something, it would be making an interactive grass shader.
