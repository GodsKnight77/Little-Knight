This is a little game I've been working on, and I decided I would give people the opportunity to play it as I work on it.
It does require a password in order to unzip.

Alpha 1.0.0 has very little functionality, so don't expect to be intertained by it for very long.

There is currently no exit button, so you have two choices, you can press alt+tab, or you could use ctrl+alt+del.
