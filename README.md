This is a little game I've been working on, and I decided I would give people the opportunity to play it as I work on it.

Alpha 1.0.0 has very little functionality, so don't expect to be intertained by it for very long. Also Little Knight is a working title.

If you're on the main page, all you have to do to download is scroll up until you see the version you want to try out (at the moment there is only Alpha 1.0.0).
Tap on it and then at the top right of the page press the download button, there ya go. It does require a password in order to unzip.
There is currently no exit button, so you have two choices, you can press alt+tab, or you could use ctrl+alt+del.
