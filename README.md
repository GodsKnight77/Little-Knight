This is a little game I've been working on, and I decided I would give people the opportunity to play it as I work on it.

Alpha v1.0.1-alpha is out now, and the combat controls are much better now. They were so janky in v1.0.0-alpha. I did remove thrusting and blocking temporarily however, until I can make them feel smooth and fun.

If you're on the main page, all you have to do to download is scroll up until you see on the right side, a button called releases.
Tap on it and then find the version you want to use, tap on that and then scroll down to the 7z file and tap that to start the download. No password required anymore for both releases.
There is currently no exit button, so you have two choices, you can press alt+tab, or you could use ctrl+alt+del.
